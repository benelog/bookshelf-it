## 인상 깊은 단락

### Introduction
> Agile acceptance testing breaks down traditional boundaries around testing, requirements and specification processes in a way that significantly improves communication on a project. 


> It is intentionally not too technical or suited only for programmers, because agile acceptance testing is not a programming technique: it is a communication technique that brings people involved in a software project closer.

> One of the main messages I want to convey with this book is that the biggest benefit of agile acceptance testing is improved communication and mutual understanding, not test automation.

### Ch1
> The hardest single part of building a software system is deciding precisely what to build.
